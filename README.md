Project 1 of the UofU full stack bootcamp

1st homework project for the UofU full stack development bootcamp. 
The goal was to clean up the div soup in the origional code created by Xander Papstine, and change the css as needed to keep it working.

There are 4 <div></div> elements I was not able to find a satifactory alternative for.
